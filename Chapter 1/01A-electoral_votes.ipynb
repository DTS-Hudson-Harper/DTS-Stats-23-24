Instead of a simple popular vote (whoever gets the most votes wins), we count \"electoral votes\" among each state. If you win a state (even by only a little bit), you get **ALL** its electoral votes. If you can obtain the majority (270) of the total 538 electoral votes, you win the presidency.\n\nThe system can lead to some *interesting* results. For example, five U.S. Presidents did not win as many votes as their opponents; yet, they still won the Presidency due to the Electoral College system."
