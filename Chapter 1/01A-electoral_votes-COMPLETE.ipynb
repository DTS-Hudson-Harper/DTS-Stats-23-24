They will explore the data to answer questions such as: *What seems to determine how many electoral votes a state gets? Which states grant voters more electoral power per person?*\n\n#### Includes:\n\n- Distinguishing between variables and values in dataframes\n- Making new variables in a data frame\n- Using proportionality to compare voter power across states\n- Classifying observations based on conditions (e.g., swing states have close voter shares)\n\n#### Background Knowledge:\n\nFor this activity, if you have students who are unfamiliar with American politics, it would be useful to explain that there are two major parties: Republican (often symbolized with the color red) and Democrat (often symbolized with the color blue). Students do not need to know the policy positions of the parties to successfully complete the activity.\n\n</div>"

If you win a state (even by only a little bit), you get **ALL** its electoral votes. If you can obtain the majority (270) of the total 538 electoral votes, you win the presidency.\n\nThe system can lead to some *interesting* results. For example, five U.S. Presidents did not win as many votes as their opponents; yet, they still won the Presidency due to the Electoral College system."
