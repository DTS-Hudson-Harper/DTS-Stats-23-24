How does winning the swing states impact a candidate's likelihood of winning the electoral college?*\n\n#### Includes:\n\n- Distinguishing between variables and values in dataframes\n- Making new variables in a data frame\n- Classifying observations based on conditions (e.g., battleground states have close voter shares)\n\n\n</div>"

These are often called the *swing states* (also called *battleground states*).\n\nTake a look at the map above.

Because the electoral college turns some small states into more empowered \"swing states,\" the issues of at least some small states will be heard by those in power. Plus, it's not like voters have no options. If they'd like their vote to have the same power as a vote in a swing state, they should move to one!\n<li>No - There is no reason that a vote from one state should be more likely to decide electoral outcomes than a vote from another state. It means that voter power isn't evenly distributed between voters, which is inherently unfair. <br><br>\n\n<b>Instructor Note:</b> \n\nThis question can be set up as a debate between students.
