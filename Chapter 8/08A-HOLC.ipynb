      "source": "### History of Redlining\n\nRedlining was a process started in the 1930s in which the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), a US federal agency, gave neighborhoods ratings to guide investment. Certain neighborhoods were colored red on HOLC maps and labeled as \"hazardous\" (see below). These \"red-lined\" neighborhoods were deemed risky investments (that is, banks and other institutions should not give loans to people trying to buy property in these areas).\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/p2TH8brH/image.png\" alt=\"map of San Francisco area showing redlined areas\" width = 80%>\n\nThese red-lined neighborhoods were predominantly home to communities of color, and this is no accident; the “hazardous” rating was in large part based on racial demographics (shown in historic documents below). In other words, redlining was an explicitly discriminatory policy. \n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/SyBmp1Qb/image.png\" alt=\"paperwork from HOLC showing percentages of foreign-born families or Negro families\" width=80%>\n\nThis history is not behind us in many ways. Today we will explore how the historic practice of redlining (legally halted with the Fair Housing Act of 1968) is running up against modern issues like global temperature rise.\n\nMany of these historically “hazardous” neighborhoods are currently more impoverished *and* experience more extreme temperatures. Neighborhoods that are poorer and have more residents of color can be 5 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit hotter in summer than wealthier, whiter parts of the same city.\n"
