Boy crickets can't do much about size but biologist Rittik Deb (National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India) observed curious behavior called **baffling**. A male cricket will chomp a hole in a leaf, shove his head and forelegs through the opening, and use the leaf as a megaphone!\n\nWatch here: https://elifesciences.org/articles/32763#video2\n\n### Motivating Questions: \n\n- Are females actually attracted by baffling? \n\n- Does amplification of chirps really lead to better sexual outcomes for male crickets? Even for those that are naturally quiet?\n\n"
