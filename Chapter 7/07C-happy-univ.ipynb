For example, for [one in 7 married Americans](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/only-1-in-3-us-marriage-proposals-are-a-surprise-engagement-ring-spend-rises-according-to-the-knot-2017-jewelry--engagement-study-300552669.html), college is the place where they met their future spouse.\n\nData analysts at [Resume.io](Resume.io) used Instagram and Amazon Rekognition (an AI tool that measures levels of emotion in human faces) to estimate the happiness levels. Thousands of Instagram photos geotagged at different universities were put through the AI tool. The data set called `happy_univ` contains the proportion of faces that register as \"happy\" for 126 universities in three different countries (United States, Great Britain, and Australia). \n\nYou can read more about Resume.io's methodology [here](https://resume.io/blog/the-happiest-schools-in-the-us-uk-and-australia) and special thanks to [Dr. Jess Hartnett](https://twitter.com/Notawful) for finding this data set.\n\n## College rankings\n\nInformation about happiness from IG photos were joined together with other information available about colleges such as the [Times Higher Education world rankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/world-ranking/detailed) and the [Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) rankings](https://cwur.org/2015.php).\n\n"
