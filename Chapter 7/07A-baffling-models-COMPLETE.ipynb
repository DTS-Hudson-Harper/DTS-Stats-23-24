These experiments examine factors that affect female attraction in crickets, such as the size of male crickets, and the loudness of their chirps, including a phenomenon known as baffling, wherein, a male cricket uses holes in leaves to amplify their chirps (hence, \"catfishing\" the female crickets by making it seem like they are louder than they really are). \n\n#### Includes:\n\n- Making multivariate word equations, data visualizations, and models\n- Interpreting best fitting equations and connecting them to the visualization of a model\n\n</div>"

Boy crickets can't do much about size but biologist Rittik Deb (National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India) observed curious behavior called **baffling**. A male cricket will chomp a hole in a leaf, shove his head and forelegs through the opening, and use the leaf as a megaphone!\n\nWatch here: https://elifesciences.org/articles/32763#video2\n\n### Motivating Questions: \n\n- Are females actually attracted by baffling? \n\n- Does amplification of chirps really lead to better sexual outcomes for male crickets? Even for those that are naturally quiet?\n\n"
