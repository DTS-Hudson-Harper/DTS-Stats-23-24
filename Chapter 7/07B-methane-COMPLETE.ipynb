But there are skeptics who do not believe human activities are linked to changes in climate.\n\nA climate change skeptic chose one summer month and one winter month from each of the years 1999-2018. For each of those months, the skeptic found data on the average global temperature and atmospheric methane level. \n\nThe skeptic claims that his data shows a **negative relationship** between methane and temperature. In other words, higher concentrations of the greenhouse gas tend to be associated with lower average global temperature. \n\nWe will take a look at this data (in the data frame `temp_data`). Is the climate change skeptic correct? Could this be evidence that greenhouse gases and human pollution aren't driving climate change? Let's explore."

So, the overall relationship is negative. \n\nHowever, this is not a very well-fitting model. There are very large residuals, as the line does not come close to predicting many of the temperatures.
