We looked at the mobility index of each college to see which ones help to bring the most people from the bottom 20% of household income to the top 20%. We saw that mid-tier schools tended to have the highest mobility rates, while low- and high-tier schools tended to have lower rates, and low-tier schools (e.g., Ivy League) tended to not admit very many students from the bottom 20% of incomes to begin with.\n\nLet's continue to explore the various factors that may contribute to a college's mobility index."

For [reference](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/), the bottom 20\\% by income earns about \\$25,500 annually while the top 20\\% earns about \\$188,000 annually. But, what if they reach the top 50% of incomes instead; should that count as social mobility?\n\nThat is one measure of the economic impact of going to college. Another way to measure the economic value of a college degree is to simply look at the mean earnings of people with different levels of education."
