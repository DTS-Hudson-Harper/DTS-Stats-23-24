The researchers were interested in whether dog therapy could help alleviate feelings of anxiety, pain, and depression during emergency room (ER) visits. Students will compare a set of patients randomly assigned to either 15 minutes of exposure to dog therapy, or 15 minutes of usual care in the ER, to see how it affects reported ratings of anxiety at various time points: Baseline anxiety, then 30 minutes after the intervention, and 90 minutes after the intervention.\n\n#### Includes:\n\n- Fitting a group model and interpreting the parameter estimates\n- Evaluating explained variation in models\n- Thinking about research design and causal relationships in the DGP\n\n#### Resources:\n\n- Optional [Printable Graph Handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KOMikJpuWSzEbiOQ0HrOWcHfGX7FFxKACtb49UBG39k/edit?usp=sharing). This handout contains images of the relevant visualizations that are made throughout the lesson. They can be used for students to manually draw on, mark up, and make notes. This can give students the chance to process the graphs more deeply, and connect them to the models they are fitting.\n\n</div>"

Several medically stable, adult patients visiting an emergency room were approached and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 15 minutes exposure to a certified therapy dog and handler (**Dog condition**), or usual care (**Control condition**). Patient-reported anxiety, pain, and depression were assessed using a 0–10 scale (10 = worst), at three time points: \n\n- baseline (before the therapy dog)\n- later (30 minutes after the therapy dog or control treatment)\n- last (90 minutes after)\n\n#### Study Procedure\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/syjV5VSK/image.png\" alt=\"Diagram of Dog Therapy Study procedure\" width=800>"

Explained variation just means that the variation in one variable varies in a way that it helps us better predict variation in another variable. With some types of analyses, we may not be able to ever know if a predictive relationship is causal or not, such as with correlation models, but with the right experimental conditions, we can reach some degree of confidence as to whether the relationship is causal or not.\n\nWe will be able to tell whether `condition` causes differences in anxiety for `later_anxiety` and `last_anxiety` (with some degree of certainty), because this study follows the research methods necessary for a true experiment: Random assignment to experimental group or control group. If there is a difference between the two groups, it could be due to dog therapy **or** randomness.\n\nIn later chapters, we will need to rule out randomness (that the two groups are different by random chance represented by the empty model).
