This time they will explore whether the type of college (for-profit, private non-profit, or public) explains variation in mobility, or whether the graduating class size of the college has anything to do with mobility.\n\n\n#### Includes:\n\n- Fitting and interpreting a model with a categorical explanatory variable.\n- Fitting and interpreting a model with a quantitative explanatory variable.\n- Connecting parameter estimates to visualizations.\n- Making predictions with models, and evaluating error off of the models.\n\n#### Resources:\n\n- Optional [Printable Graph Handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BCSPksPRqOm36RPtyPXM714sKqdfMzIy1sppwTLfpc8/edit?usp=sharing). This handout contains images of the relevant visualizations that are made throughout the lesson. They can be used for students to manually draw on, mark up, and make notes. This can give students the chance to process the graphs more deeply, and connect them to the models they are fitting.\n\n</div>"

We looked at the mobility index of each college to see which ones help to bring the most people from the bottom 20% of household income to the top 20%. We saw that mid-tier schools tended to have the highest mobility rates, while low- and high-tier schools tended to have lower rates, and low-tier schools (e.g., Ivy League) tended to not admit very many students from the bottom 20% of incomes to begin with.\n\nLet's continue to explore the various factors that may contribute to a college's mobility index."
