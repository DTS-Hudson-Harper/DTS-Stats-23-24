In particular, for low-income students, colleges present themselves as places of social mobility. If you can score a letter of admission, obtain financing, and work hard for four years, you'll get a degree that will open personal and financial doors for the rest of your life.\n\nHowever, critics have challenged the above narrative. They say that colleges simply reproduce current social hiearchies. They claim that, for the most part, colleges serve and/or graduate students from already high-income families. In doing so, they cement inequities in opportunity."

It seems that Tier 3 schools have generally the highest rate of mobility; however, there are several outlier Tier 5 and higher schools that have relatively high rates as well. Interestingly, Tier 11 & 12 schools (which had very high rates of accepting students from the bottom 20% income households) had low rates on this metric. This suggests that, while they accept many students from bottom 20% families, they are not the most successful at giving opportunities for mobility.  \n\n</div>"
