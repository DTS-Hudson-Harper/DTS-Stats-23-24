In particular, for low-income students, colleges present themselves as places of social mobility. If you can score a letter of admission, obtain financing, and work hard for four years, you'll get a degree that will open personal and financial doors for the rest of your life.\n\nHowever, critics have challenged the above narrative. They say that colleges simply reproduce current social hiearchies. They claim that, for the most part, colleges serve and/or graduate students from already high-income families. In doing so, they cement inequities in opportunity."
